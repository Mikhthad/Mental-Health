# Overview
The Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health dataset provides a detailed view of the relationship between remote working conditions and the mental well-being of employees from various industries and regions. The dataset captures multiple aspects of work-life dynamics, including job roles, work location, mental health conditions, productivity changes, and social isolation, among others. Each employee is uniquely identified and categorized based on demographic factors such as age, gender, and years of experience, allowing for granular insights into how different groups of employees respond to remote work.
